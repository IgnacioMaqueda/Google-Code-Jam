# Google Code Jam

These are my solutions to some Google Code Jam problems.

Some of them were made during the **contest** and some were made as **practice** for the contests of the following years.

Some of them are **full** solutions (they pass all the test sets) and some are **partial** solutions (they pass some test sets but not all of them).

## Solutions:
